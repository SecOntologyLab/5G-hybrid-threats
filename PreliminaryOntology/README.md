# 5G Hybrid Threats Ontology

This repository contains the preliminary ontology developed as part of the **5G Hybrid Threats** project. It provides a foundational representation of concepts, entities, and relationships relevant to hybrid threats in 5G and next-generation networks.

## Files in this Repository
- `ontology.ttl`: The ontology file in [TURTLE](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) format, representing hybrid threats for 5G infrastructure.
- `shapes.ttl`: A SHACL shapes file for validating the ontology's structure and conformance to specific rules.

## Usage
The ontology can be used for:
- Understanding the relationships and entities involved in hybrid threats in 5G networks.
- Validating data models using the SHACL shapes file.

### SHACL Validation
To validate the ontology using SHACL:
1. Clone this repository locally.
2. Use the Python validation script provided in the [`scripts`](https://github.com/SecOntologyLab/5G-hybrid-threats/tree/main/scripts) directory.
3. Follow the instructions in the `scripts` repository to set up and run the validation.
