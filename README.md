# 5G Hybrid Threats Ontology

This repository hosts the **5G Hybrid Threats Ontology**, an early-stage initiative to develop a structured representation of hybrid threats targeting 5G infrastructure. The ontology aligns with best practices in knowledge representation and is designed to evolve into a comprehensive framework for threat modeling, analysis, and response.

## Goals

The primary objectives of this project are:
- To represent hybrid threats and their interactions with 5G systems in a machine-readable ontology format (currently in **TURTLE**).
- To align with existing cybersecurity knowledge organization systems (KOS) such as **ENISA**, **STIX**, and other standards.
- To provide a foundation for reasoning, querying, and analysis of 5G-related cybersecurity events using tools like **SPARQL** and **SHACL**.

## Current Status

Currently, two versions of the ontology are in play: 
1) The first is in a preliminary stage, 'A preliminary ontology for 5G network security: hybrid threats, risk reduction, compliance', submitted to 2025 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Security and Resilience, forthcoming in conference proceedings, https://www.ieee-csr.org/
2) The second, the 5G Hybrid Threats Ontology, is significantly more advanced, and its development from the ground up is revealed in Paskauskas RA. 'Decoding 5G security: toward a hybrid threat ontology' [version 2]. Open Res Europe 2024, 4:34 (https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.16916.1).

## Repository Contents

- The primary ontology files are in **TURTLE** representation.
- Example queries and data for testing and validation are available. 
- Documentation describes various procedures and testing vehicles of the development process.

## Next Steps

1. Expand the ontology to include additional 5G-specific assets and threats.
2. Publish updates and invite contributions from the research community.
