# 5G Hybrid Threats Ontology

This repository hosts the **5G Hybrid Threats Ontology**, an early-stage initiative to develop a structured representation of hybrid threats targeting 5G infrastructure. The ontology aligns with best practices in knowledge representation and is designed to evolve into a comprehensive framework for threat modeling, analysis, and response.

## Goals

The primary objectives of this project are:
- To represent hybrid threats and their interactions with 5G systems in a machine-readable ontology format (currently in **TURTLE**).
- To align with existing cybersecurity knowledge organization systems (KOS) such as **ENISA**, **STIX**, and other standards.
- To provide a foundation for reasoning, querying, and analysis of 5G-related cybersecurity events using tools like **SPARQL** and **SHACL**.

## Current Status

The ontology is in its preliminary stage, featuring:
- Key concepts and relationships specific to hybrid threats in 5G infrastructure.
- Initial validation using **SHACL** and reasoning tools such as **Protégé**.
- Future plans to integrate concepts from standard KOS (e.g., STIX) and add case studies.

## Repository Contents

- `ontology.ttl`: The primary ontology file in **TURTLE** format.
- Example queries and data for testing and validation (coming soon).
- Documentation and methodology describing the development process.

## Next Steps

1. Align the ontology with standard cybersecurity vocabularies (e.g., STIX, ENISA Taxonomies).
2. Expand the ontology to include additional 5G-specific assets and threats.
3. Publish updates and invite contributions from the research community.
